This is a game of tic tac toe I made by myself for fun and to learn some stuff along the way while doing it. It took me only several hours of work to finish (all in 1 day) and in it I learned a few useful things for future projects such as the importance of testing code thoroughly while developing, to catch bugs very easily before they become a core part of the project and are much harder to fix.

Overall this project was great and I enjoyed it :)
